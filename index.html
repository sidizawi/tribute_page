                Al-Khwarizmi is one of the most famous astronomers, geologist, and mathematician at the time of the Golden Era of Muslims.
                 He is also <em>the inventor of many mathematical methods and a branch of math</em>, called <em>Algebra</em>. 
                 Furthermore, he was the first to use decimals to express the fractions.<br>
                Al-Khwarizmi has done many discoveries in the field of mathematics, astronomy, and geology. Some of his main discoveries 
                and contribution are:<br><br>

                <em>Algebra Invention –</em>
                
                The most famous work of Al-Khwarizmi was the development of algebra, a branch of math that deals with symbols and the 
                operations between them. Algebra is a very important field in mathematics and forms the foundation of modern science and 
                technology. Al-Khwarizmi defined the algebra in his famous book of mathematics, called Hisab Al-Jabr Wa-Al-Muqabala. This 
                book was very famous and was translated in many languages, before the dawn of Europeans Era, to teach and learn algebra. 
                The book has also discussed the solution of the first-degree and second-degree equations; both analytically and geometrically. 
                It also discussed some methods of solving algebraic problems.<br><br>

                <em>Algorithms –</em> 
                
                Algorithm is an Arabic word which is now used to define a process in which certain steps are performed for the solution of a 
                problem; especially in the computer The concept of algorithms was first given by Al-Khwarizmi to solve certain problems in 
                defined steps of calculations. Today, computer widely use algorithms to solve a wide variety of problems and decision making. 
                Due to the introduction of the concept of algorithms, Al-Khwarizmi is sometimes referred to as the father of computer science.

                <em>Improvements in Sundials –</em> 
                
                Sundial is an instrument which shows time with the help of the position of the Sun. The sun forms a shadow of the pointer 
                on a plate which contains marks of the time period. The shadow of the pointer rotates on the marks when the sun changes its 
                position. Al-Khwarizmi improved the design of sundials and made them a universal instrument for checking the time in any part 
                of the world.<br><br>

                <em>Map Development –</em> 
                
                Al-Khwarizmi developed an accurate map of that time with the help of 70 geographers.
